I have a Master's Degree in Cell and Molecular Biology. I was previously employed in Dr. Sabarinathan Radhakrishnan's lab at NCBS as a Graduate Trainee. I have experience in large cancer database management and analysis (PCAWG, TCGA). I am skilled in Python, R, and Bash programming languages. Along with this, I have experience in basic molecular biology techniques from my internships done during BS-MS.
