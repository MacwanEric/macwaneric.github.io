From my research experience, I have developed a keen interest in understanding tumor evolution. Cancer development, as an evolutionary process within an individual, mirrors species evolution. Tumors evolve by mutation and selection acting on cells in a tissue. Also, population genetics can be used to describe mutation frequency present in the DNA of tumor cell populations.

My goal is to understand cancer evolution for better early detection methods. Pinpointing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) mutation in the tumor population over its evolutionary time scale will help to understand the dynamics of cancer initiation. Analysis of driver mutations across different cancer types has shown that early clonal mutations have less diversity than late subclonal mutations. 30% of tumors in this study had a whole-genome duplication event several decades before diagnosis [1], which gives a window for early cancer detection!

Growing up in a family fighting cancer for many years, I lost my maternal grandmother due to late diagnosis, lack of resources, and knowledge. A few years later, my mother was also diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer. But this time, we were able to get ahead of the situation due to early diagnosis and previous experience. Studying cancer is a purpose and a passion of my life. Working in Dr. Radhakrishnanâ€™s lab gave me direction to follow a bioinformatic approach in solving challenging problems in cancer research.

Gaining insights through understanding cancer as an evolutionary system and selection as a readout, and getting experience in building mathematical and computational approaches in pinpointing driver mutation occurrence order during cancer initiation will help me grow as a researcher.

In the long run, I want to establish a research environment focusing on bridging basic and translational research in the field of cancer genomics.
