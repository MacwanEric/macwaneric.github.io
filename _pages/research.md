From my research experience, I have developed a keen interest in understanding tumor evolution. Cancer development, as an evolutionary process within an individual, mirrors species evolution. Tumors evolve by mutation and selection acting on cells in a tissue. Also, the frequency of the mutations present in the DNA of tumor cell populations can be described using the framework of population genetics.

My research goal is to understand cancer evolution for better early detection methods. Pinpointing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) mutation in the tumor population over its evolutionary time scale will help to understand the initiation environment of cancer in different tumors. Analysis of driver mutations across the cancer types, as early clonal vs late subclonal, shows less diversity in early clonal mutations. 30% of tumors in this study had a whole-genome duplication event several decades before diagnosis [1], which gives a window for early cancer diagnosis!

Other parts of cancer research which can help in understanding cancer initiation events:

- Role of genomic instability in recurrence of cancer.
- Tumor subclones contain drivers that are under positive selection. They play roles in subclonal expansion [1]. The role of various subclones in drug resistance remains to be investigated.
- Single-cell analysis of clinical samples to track drug-induced tumor evolution will give us insights into epigenetic plasticity in drug resistance. [2]

Gaining insights through understanding cancer as an evolutionary system and selection as a readout, and getting experience in building mathematical and computational approaches in pinpointing driver mutation occurrence order during cancer initiation will help me take further steps in my research direction.
