## Education and academic employment

I have completed my Master’s degree in Cell and Molecular Biology from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat in 2018.

As part of my curriculum, I worked as a summer intern in Dr. Neelesh Dahanukar’s Molecular phylogenetics lab at IISER PUNE, where I studied molecular phylogeny and phylogeography of freshwater fishes of sub-family *Danioninae* from India. Barcoding gene (Cytochrome C oxidase) of fishes collected (by Dahanukar) over 20 years from all over India were sequenced.

I also worked as a summer intern in Dr. Rahul Siddharthan’s Computational biology lab at IMSC Chennai, where I studied prototype development (BLAST) and understanding the mathematical background of alignment softwares. For prototype development, I used python and probability-based models for predicting transcription factor (TF) binding sites.

I was previously employed in Dr. Sabarinathan Radhakrishnan's lab at NCBS as a Graduate Trainee for a year after post-graduation. The work involved fishing and understanding the nature of Dominant Negative Mutations in tumor suppressor genes across tumor types using TCGA and PCAWG cancer datasets.
