## Education and academic employment

I have completed my Master’s degree in Cell and Molecular Biology from The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat in 2018.

As part of my curriculum, I worked as a summer intern in Dr. Neelesh Dahanukar’s Molecular Phylogenetics lab at IISER Pune, India, where I studied molecular phylogeny and phylogeography of freshwater fishes of sub-family Danioninae from India. The project was divided into two parts wherein the first part, I was involved in the barcoding of the Danioninae fish family using DNA extraction, PCR of the barcoding gene (Cytochrome C oxidase), and purification of the PCR products. The second part focused on bioinformatic analysis including sequence editing, genetic data mining, sequence alignment, phylogenetic hypothesis testing and, phylogeographical mapping. 

I also worked as a summer intern in Dr. Rahul Siddharthan’s Computational Biology lab at IMSC Chennai, India, where I studied computational prediction and characterisation of regulatory sites and cis-regulatory modules. The project involved prototype development (BLAST) and understanding the mathematical background of different alignment softwares. For prototype development, I used Python and probability-based models for predicting transcription factor (TF) binding sites. 

My broad interests lie in the field of Cancer genomics. In order to pursue my goals, I joined Dr. Sabarinathan Radhakrishnan's lab at NCBS, Bangalore, India, as a Graduate Trainee after obtaining my degree. My work involved fishing and understanding the nature of Dominant Negative Mutations in tumor suppressor genes across tumor types using TCGA and PCAWG datasets. We found potential candidates for Dominant Negative Mutations. The study was carried further to understand their position and function on their respective protein structures. During this period I acquired extensive working knowledge in the analysis of cancer genomics data using R/Bioconductor, Python, and Linux shell scripting.
