Hi! I’m Eric. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc in cell and molecular biology from [Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology] at the [Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda](https://www.msubaroda.ac.in/Dr_Vikram_Sarabhai_Institute_of_Cell_and_Molecular_Biology) , Vadodara, India in 2018. After receiving my M.Sc. degree, I was previously employed in Dr. Sabarinathan Radhakrishnan's lab at [National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS)](https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/sabari) as a graduate trainee. I’m a trained molecular biologist with a background in bioinformatics. And I have just enough expertise in data science to make trouble. 

## Inspiration 
While working in the cancer genomics lab I developed a keen interest in understanding tumour evolution for building better early detection methods and treatment approaches. Analysis of driver mutations across different cancer types has shown that early clonal mutations have less diversity than late subclonal mutations. 30% of tumours in the study conducted by Gerstung et. al. (2020) had a whole-genome duplication event several decades before diagnosis, which gives a window for early cancer detection! 	This is an interesting study and it is also the reason for my motivation to pursue a doctoral position.

## My reading habits
I try to select papers that help me achieve a specific aim. As papers don't explain everything, I first try to identify common concepts and techniques. I use review articles to study different schools of thought in the field. This helps to put outcomes from different articles into perspective and helps me stay up-to-date on the research. I focus my attention on breakthrough papers for gaining insights into the most recent developments and think of ways to go a step further. I also use Twitter to stay up-to-date on the latest developments.

Recently I have added a webpage [Cancer Interest Feed](https://macwaneric.github.io/cancer_rss_feed/) to generate RSS feeds of manuscripts, review articles and news highlights for my research interest topics. I’m using PubMed to generate RSS links and osmofeed as a feed extractor. Here I am channelling extracted articles on my webpage to keep everything in one place for my ease of access and greater control over the content. 

## Philosophical approach toward science
“If you put effort into things it will work out.” A philosophy my father passed on to me. And it worked really well in school as well as college years. This also explains how our Indian education system works as I was able to fit well with this mindset. My education system trained me to incline more towards mindless hard work. It did help me to see one step ahead but made me go through embarrassing suffering to come up with an idea or approach. This philosophy started crumbling during my research experience as a graduate trainee as my mentor didn’t give me the step-by-step instructions I was used to, and constantly encouraged me to come up with ideas and projects. It was intimidating, confusing and exciting to lead my own research project as I no longer had a decision-maker with more experience to follow. It felt like walking on a bumpy road with troubleshooting, trial and error at every stage. But my excitement and curiosity grew as I started pushing myself to read and think at a deeper level. I consider my stay in Dr. Radhakrishnan’s lab to be the most valuable experience.

I learned that deeper understanding comes from deeper knowledge. In simple words the more you read the more you feel confident. But knowledge here is subjective because it comes from both experience and literature. And you can get lost exploring vast literature while losing sight of the goal. For this reason I ask myself how much sense of control I feel over the question/task/project. To feel more sense of control I follow my reading habit described above.

“It is good to be quick, But it is important to be deep”
